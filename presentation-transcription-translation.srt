Tatry IT

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Tatry IT

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good evening.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to another Tatry IT meetup.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tatry IT

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I always say that it is a name that is not entirely correct,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because as you can see today,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we are not only talking about IT topics,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but also about topics that are not entirely IT,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that are around IT.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is more of a technical, scientific,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we can call it lifestyle,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
self-realization, productivity.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So everything that is related to the fact

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that a person can somehow move,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
educate and so on.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am saying this because I see people here

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
whom I have not yet seen so far.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I am glad that anyone who is new here

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
has come between us.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We met in such a standard number.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Of those 10 to 15 people,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it is usually such a perfect number

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
for the city of Poprad,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
since this region is neither big

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
nor the city is big.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And if you think that there are few of us,

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you don't have to worry at all,

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because even in other larger cities

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
there is a standard number of 10, 15.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If someone is interested,

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
there can be 25 people or even 50.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But today we already have the 35th meetup.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I will give this slide now

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so that I can remember it.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So we have already met 35 times

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
here in Coworking Poprad.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have not been anywhere else so far.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you, Tomáš, that we can be here.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tomáš is in the back and he is directing it here.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Today's topic, as I mentioned,

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
will not be direct or purely technical.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
IT will be more about productivity,

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
about self-development.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am very happy about the opportunity

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because despite the fact that

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have been trying to be

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
either productive

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
or not dependent on technology,

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but rather have technology

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
as my tool,

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
a tool to serve me,

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
it is difficult.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I am curious what I will learn today.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will not introduce myself

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because I will introduce myself in a moment.

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So this is our presenter.

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And if you have any questions,

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I assume you can ask them directly

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or you can leave them for later.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Or you can use Slido

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
with the hashtag TatriIT.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So if you know how to use Slido

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you do not want to interrupt

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and you want to ask a question

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and you want to ask at the end,

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
feel free to use Slido.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We will take a look at it.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Those of you who are not in our newsletter,

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will repeat it,

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you can sign up for the newsletter.

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Just go to www.tatriit.sk

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and if you wait a moment,

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
maybe 5 seconds,

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
a pop-up will pop up

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and you can write your name and email.

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And you will be notified

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
when there will be a new meetup.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And in connection with that,

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
we have three more terms for the next meetup

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
until June.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That means that we will meet

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the closest after this meetup in April.

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then we will meet in May

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and even in June.

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That term is not yet completely clear.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But we can tell you

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that there will be one non-technical theme,

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
one very practical technical theme

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and then the last one will be very technical.

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So that's okay,

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
we will meet on the 24th.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
On the 24th,

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Miki Plichta R

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
will talk to us

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
about LinkedIn.

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How to prepare your LinkedIn account.

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It is not enough

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
to write a CV,

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you have to present yourself

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
on social networks.

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So Miki Plichta will come to us

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and talk about LinkedIn profiles

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
for technical people

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
or for scientists.

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let me know.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everyone needs this kind of information.

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's get to our topic today.

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Samo, welcome to us

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
for the second time.

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's good to see you there.

117
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So you are not a newbie,

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but you are here

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
all the time.

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So come on

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and tell us

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
what will be your topic

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and your stage.

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's start this presentation.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was supposed to be a video,

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but you don't notice it.

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There should be more of them,

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but let's go.

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are a digital child.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is something

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I had to admit

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
roughly two years ago,

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
more than two years ago.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was the reality

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
with which I met

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
on my journey of life.

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it looked

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
like this.

140
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Imagine that the camera

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is moving now on this video

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and shows you the whole room,

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the computer,

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the screen.

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And this is what it looks like

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
when you are a digital child.

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You simply don't see the border

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
between the digital world

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and the real world.

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Everything is merged into one.

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are a digital child

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
when technology is in your way

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to movement.

154
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You spend an enormous amount

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
of online content consumption.

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It can be on any social network.

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It can be a TV series.

158
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You work remotely

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and go straight for the screen

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
from the bed.

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are a digital child

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
when technologies

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
do not help you

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to be fully concentrated in your work.

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are interrupted by irrelevant notifications

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
at any time during your work.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't have enough concentration

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and every moment you need

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
a dopamine shot

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
to find something more interesting

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
than your work.

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know.

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are a digital child

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
when technologies have a negative impact

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
on your relationship development.

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Instead of meeting people

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
in person,

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you prefer to live

179
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in your bubble behind a screen

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and simply don't want

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to confront yourself

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
through the people you meet.

183
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Feel free to post

184
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
as you see fit.

185
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Simply, technology

186
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
prevents you from living

187
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
fully in your present moment.

188
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is something I grew up with

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
in my life.

190
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I needed to make a change.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I needed to transform.

192
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is my way

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to digital freedom.

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or how I got

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
technology under control in my life.

196
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Imagine this.

197
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was supposed to be a video.

198
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It is simply a man

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who is connected to cables

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that represent

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
various applications we use.

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
To go through

203
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
transformation,

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the technologies

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
start to serve the man

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and not the man

207
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
who serves the technology

208
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
as it is sometimes in our lives.

209
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In my case, it was certainly so.

210
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Before I start

211
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
with my story,

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will talk about myself.

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I am a web programmer

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and I make projects

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that reflect my values.

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is my way to digital freedom

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
or digital freedom

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
if we translate it from English.

219
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Free with tech.

220
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's get started.

221
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Get ready

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because this will be a tough ride.

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Digital native.

224
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What is this term?

225
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am a man who grew up

226
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
with a phone in his hand.

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At that time, various communication tools

228
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
such as Pockets,

229
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Facebook,

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I installed it on my phone.

231
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was among the first

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
million users.

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I had my first phone in my hands

234
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
in the third year of primary school.

235
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is a bit of a misunderstanding

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
of my context.

237
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I continue my education.

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I thank my parents

239
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that they really led me to active movement.

240
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And until today it happened to me

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
as you can see in these photos

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
with my friends in the mountains

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and on various bicycle routes.

244
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
However, the reality was such

245
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that technologies in my life

246
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
took the first place

247
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
after some time.

248
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Simply yes.

249
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I went to trainings,

250
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I did sports,

251
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I tried to listen to my parents.

252
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's say it was like that at the time.

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Because they advised me

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
not to sit so long

255
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
behind the computer.

256
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Of course, we didn't know

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
what was connected to it.

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because it was a new world

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of games.

260
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Imagine the picture

261
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
where there is a computer game

262
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
on the screen

263
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and some kind of digital tool

264
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
where I create graphics

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and code, programs.

266
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Just like this

267
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
my journey started.

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
First it was a lot of games

269
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
then it was the end of primary school

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
graphic design and what not.

271
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But they were not the same

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
in the world.

273
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But the boundaries

274
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Simply, the digital space was gaining me more and more, that was the reality.

275
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here you can imagine, the boy has the digital glasses on him and the real world is fighting with the digital world.

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The switching of these two worlds there is simple.

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And the digital one was gradually winning in my life.

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Try to guess, maybe, what color represents, when it comes to time allocation, in a specific day,

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
maybe in my age, when I was in high school, what color represents the time behind the screen, in your opinion?

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Any other tips?

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All of them? That would be a good extreme, then.

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was the only one who got to that point, even though I was programming 24 hours a day.

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you for the tips.

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You were very close.

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And you were right. Red color, almost 10 hours a day, even 10 hours a day.

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was games, it was a combination of games and the creation of something digital.

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The computer created a very significant amount of that time in my life.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, the tax was clear.

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In the 20s, I counted it, I spent one year just playing games.

290
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Just playing games, there was no time for mobile phones and so on.

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's more than 8,000 hours, right?

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Imagine you're sitting at the computer.

293
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Imagine, there's a tax there.

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it's actually that I'm organized in that digital space, but I really can't go in the direction I need or want.

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm connected on social networks with various people, friends or not.

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And the real connection, as if when I meet, it's not there at all.

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm informed by various channels, but I can't focus at the moment on what I need.

298
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so I went from this world, primary, secondary school, I went to the world of high school.

299
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And there, of course, it was very natural for me.

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That yes, a programmer.

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Great.

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can sit at the computer, it doesn't make me a problem in ten-hour shifts.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I'm going to program tasks instead of playing games.

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It was so natural.

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's how I decided.

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And it was in the same way some kind of comfort zone for me all the time.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was it myself, a computer, it was digital communication.

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Maybe even an excessive amount of digital communication.

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Non-stop internet connection.

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The management of information in a digital space.

311
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Really.

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
During high school, I thought so.

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It was probably 10-15 notebooks that I wrote.

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Most of the things were in a digital space, really.

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
More about that, that a person studies programming and mostly the right time on the computer.

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I decided to take a radical step in life.

317
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hey, I need to mention that I started working at a high level and I had a lot of flexibility at work.

318
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was great at work.

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But a person simply has to grasp their life into their own hands.

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And they have to set some limits.

321
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's how I realized it at that time, after high school.

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And in fact, a radical step came when I started digital applications.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
All the solutions that I have in my life, for example, evidence of some things I want to do.

324
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Tudučka, notes, digital calendars.

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Digital communication.

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
In short, everything was in that digital space.

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A very important part of my life.

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I decided that this doesn't work this way.

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because there was the joint debt that I presented before.

330
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And so I took a journal, a piece of paper, a notebook.

331
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I migrated everything there.

332
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
All the information that was important to me.

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Everything I need to do.

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
All my thoughts.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In short, digital stopped working for me.

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's how I gave up.

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So, 100% of the attention was in my hands.

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And someone would say that it's counterproductive.

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because we have all the digital tools here.

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why not use them?

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But in this starting point, when a person finds himself,

342
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that he is simply influenced by these technologies to such an extent

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that they rather disrupt his life in these three main areas of life

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
than develop it in the positive direction.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So it was inevitable.

346
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Really.

347
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Take a pen and start writing.

348
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It turned out that writing is good.

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In fact, it will teach a person to think a little better.

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And so on.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Maybe you all know it.

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But really, when a person grows up with technologies

353
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and maybe he is not used to writing at all,

354
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it will work out.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's how some kind of purposeful existence started in my life.

356
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's why I started writing.

357
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When a person starts to realize things more,

358
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I hope I've crossed the line.

359
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But I don't think I have.

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay.

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We have a problem here.

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It works for me.

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's fine.

364
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It doesn't work at all.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay.

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll try it.

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's lagging.

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It doesn't work.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There's a high response, I guess.

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is the previous slide.

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We have to go on now.

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So what worked for me?

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The first building pillar on the way to digital freedom,

374
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
as I mentioned.

375
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It didn't work for me.

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I left my phone without a critical application.

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I really had an e-mail and a number.

378
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
For a certain period of time.

379
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It really wasn't necessary for the digital space to be limited

380
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and for me not to be so accessible.

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I had to send a diary out of the digital space.

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Because we can take an application to write a diary,

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but I was set up in such a way

384
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that I didn't see it as a solution.

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So that's why I started writing.

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And marking my habits on a daily basis.

387
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And some reflection.

388
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it was definitely a very important point

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
on this journey of mine

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
to look at the past every day.

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
To reflect on the past.

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I just knew how to move on.

393
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And it all worked out on paper.

394
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It was the goal.

395
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Can we go on?

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So, technologies need to be used.

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why are they here?

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why would we work like this on paper?

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
After a while, I got to the point

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
that I can make some things more effective,

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but it was already a different starting point.

403
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It was already a point that some things

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
weren't as effective.

405
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And the first application,

406
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
which I learned,

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
was the digital calendar.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I was more productive thanks to it.

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't have to write it down on paper

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
what I should do when.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So there was a question

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
where to draw the line

413
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
between the real world

414
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and the digital world.

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That allowed me to take that step.

416
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
To write everything.

417
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So that allowed me to draw the line.

418
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Where do I put it?

419
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Where is the writing poison?

420
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How do I say it?

421
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The digital calendar.

422
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Then the social networks.

423
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I also used them,

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but after a while,

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
some of them maybe

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
bring motivation to the movement.

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why not bring them back

428
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
into your life?

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Then the other networks

430
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
really didn't help me.

431
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The energy there

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
wasn't good enough.

433
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't need to know

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
what someone is doing.

435
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I met someone ten years ago

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and what he's doing in Malta.

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And so on.

438
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So I didn't need

439
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
some social networks.

440
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And everyone answers this question

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
on their own.

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And the simple goal for me is

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to hold on to some

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
positive energy.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So,

446
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
my attention

447
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
was really a priority.

448
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Number one.

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And by bringing these digital tools

450
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
into my life,

451
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I tried to keep it

452
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so that it would be

453
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
like that forever.

454
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Simply,

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
to know how to focus

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
on the present moment.

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And those tools

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
shouldn't take

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
too much

460
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
attention.

461
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If a digital tool

462
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
doesn't serve

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
in the development

464
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
of relationships,

465
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
movement

466
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
or

467
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
work,

468
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
if it's not

469
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
really a positive influence,

470
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
then I'll simply

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
say goodbye to it.

472
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We can go on.

473
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, yes.

474
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What works for me

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
when it comes to

476
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
digital minimalism?

477
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Maybe another principle

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
on the way

479
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to digital freedom.

480
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Writing things

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
into a diary

482
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is the first step.

483
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But the diary

484
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
is not always with me.

485
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't want

486
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
the paper

487
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
to get wet

488
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
in the rain.

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So,

490
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
of course,

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I start using applications.

492
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is where

493
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the most important

494
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
point comes in.

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What I still use

496
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
today,

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I simply

498
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
write it

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
into the application

500
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but then I rewrite it

501
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
because I simply

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
found out

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that writing

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
is really important.

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A person

506
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
will filter

507
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
a lot of things

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
he realizes.

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So,

510
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the diary

511
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
didn't go anywhere.

512
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It really remained

513
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
a central system

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
for me.

515
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That is to say,

516
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the point came

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and I said

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that technology

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
is an expansion

520
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and not

521
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
a basis

522
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
of my life.

523
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And this is something

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that one needs

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to realize

526
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
when he grew up

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
with technologies.

528
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Simply,

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
the digital world

530
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
can come

531
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
as close

532
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and as deeply

533
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
under the skin

534
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
as it is.

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Simply,

536
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
this border

537
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
is invisible.

538
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
As I said.

539
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Likewise,

540
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the strategies

541
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
of Zero Inbox

542
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
you may know,

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
zero storage, or it's just that

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
as soon as I receive an email,

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I need to either archive it, delete it,

546
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
or put it away. The goal is

547
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to keep the inbox empty, so it helps

548
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
with concentration and so that we don't waste too much time

549
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
in applications. I started asking myself

550
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
sometimes, when we write on paper,

551
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
where would our computing power go? Maybe

552
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when visualizing data, when we want to see some historical data, maybe how my

553
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
habits develop in time, maybe I want to communicate

554
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
online. These questions,

555
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
where does computing power go,

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
helped me to

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
bring these digital tools into my life, but

558
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
in a more conscious way. And I knew why I had them.

559
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The HESEL report is also a very good

560
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
strategy to reflect on our digital

561
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
stop, and that is where the information about us is located.

562
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I have a list of all the services I use online, and it's

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
a central place where I can see

564
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
what I need and what I don't need. These are some

565
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
digital dependencies that we can influence and reflect on.

566
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Can we go on?

567
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, I live with a goal, I am focused,

568
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and what else could there be as a third pillar

569
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
on the way to digital freedom? I discovered that

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it is greater control and privacy.

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When, how, what to do online.

572
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
To perceive the internet as a public space, despite the fact that

573
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
it is secure, of course, our communication cannot read it,

574
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
but as a human being, there is a border between paper

575
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and technology, so it is more sensitive to its privacy,

576
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and in fact, it evaluates whether the information can be

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
on the internet, whether I am comfortable to leave the information on the internet.

578
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's imagine control as

579
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
some piece of paper where emails are printed,

580
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
maybe some of you do it, and you want to be sure

581
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that you have the email, you have it, it simply does not disappear anywhere in the matrix.

582
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We can imagine privacy as

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
some envelope that comes in mail to me and was not broken,

584
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
simply no one read it. These questions are in the digital space,

585
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
they are here and they need to be asked. Who has my information, who has access to it?

586
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Are my information a product?

587
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because the service is free. How can the service work when it is free

588
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and I use it? That is the question. And I want these

589
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
my data to be used, let's say, for advertising purposes

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or something.

591
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Data transfer. If I create

592
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
some file in the Apple ecosystem, I can look at this file

593
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
on Windows. I can export data

594
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
from the system to which I decided to use it.

595
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I can transfer my data from one service to another. What are the dependencies there?

596
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Does the service allow me to erase my data?

597
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
All these questions are related to our digital step

598
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and they started to show up in my life. Where do I want

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
my information to be stored? Of course, if I want

600
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
complete control,

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can run a cloud server at home and have 100% control,

602
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but there is already some responsibility for the safety of these data.

603
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We no longer outsource it to any company to take care of it. But we have

604
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the control and there is the possibility.

605
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
These are some things that I am discovering now. This is the third point on my path.

606
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The third is the last. That is,

607
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the current situation is such that people probably install applications

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and do not think about where the information is, who has access to them.

609
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
When a person gradually goes through

610
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the awareness of digital minimalism, he starts to solve these questions.

611
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
At least that's how it was on my path. And it still is. The path continues.

612
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is not the final state. What worked for me

613
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
regarding technological independence?

614
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This slide is a bit strange, sorry.

615
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There is a link digitalsloboda.sk, so please,

616
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if you want, you can come there later, there is also a quiz

617
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I will get to later, but these slides with my recommendations

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
or what works for me are available on this web.

619
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I will just mention a few types.

620
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Diversification of online services providers.

621
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It is nice to be Apple, Google, Microsoft,

622
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
but it is really easy to work together,

623
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
only that this is what we let ourselves be drawn into.

624
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The more we use from one provider, the easier it is for him

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to get even more of our information.

626
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Diversification of providers, the use of various services,

627
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
notes, calendar, SEO manager, various providers.

628
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It is nice to see the boundaries.

629
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What does a provider allow us to do?

630
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What not?

631
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I can also evaluate whether our digital platform

632
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
has something to do with that provider.

633
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The use of email alias.

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
An email contains our name and address.

635
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We can reveal our identity to it.

636
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That is why, for example,

637
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the magic journal 1234

638
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
alias.sk,

639
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
sends messages to samuel-gmail.sk.

640
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Maybe a bit of a controversial opinion

641
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
regarding online communication,

642
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
for example, direct communication

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
via Whatsapp, Facebook,

644
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
or whatever you use,

645
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
to perceive it as a meeting on the street.

646
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I see my friends,

647
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
we talk,

648
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we say goodbye at the end,

649
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but this is the end.

650
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I simply do not use the application

651
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
for communication,

652
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
in order to store my whole history

653
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
with this person.

654
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
As soon as there is some useful information

655
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
for my future,

656
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I extract it to some external system,

657
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
for example, to my diary.

658
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
In this case, I eliminate the need

659
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
to go to the application

660
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
if I want to read something.

661
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Simply, everything important

662
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
is independent of the provider and service provider.

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Also,

664
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
the application is divided

665
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
into several levels.

666
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We have some critical warnings,

667
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
we want them to keep coming,

668
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
we have some normal warnings,

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
there may be some number

670
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
on the application icon

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
in the phone,

672
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and then I open it

673
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
when I need it,

674
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
when I have time for it,

675
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
when I have some free time.

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And then there are some unwanted warnings,

677
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
so go through the settings

678
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
of the application.

679
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So, maybe one more tip,

680
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
there are more of them,

681
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
but change the endless

682
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
content records to the final ones.

683
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So, really,

684
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
in such two phases,

685
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
go through the social network

686
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
in the first one,

687
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
maybe in five minutes,

688
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the endless record,

689
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
choose something interesting from it,

690
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
store it in the record

691
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that is final, which I control,

692
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
empty it,

693
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and when I empty the record

694
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
that I have filled,

695
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it is the final point

696
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
when I finish

697
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and look at the endless records

698
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in the social networks.

699
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So,

700
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
before this transformation,

701
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
really glued to the screen,

702
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I lost,

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I would say,

704
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
some minimal ability

705
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
to focus on the longer term

706
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and the use of pre-selected applications

707
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and settings,

708
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I didn't think about

709
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
any digital step at all.

710
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And then,

711
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
after the transformation,

712
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't know what is doomscrolling,

713
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
simply, yes, I am here and now,

714
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I work with people around me,

715
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and of course,

716
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
those influences are there all the time,

717
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I grew up with technologies

718
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and it influenced me,

719
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but it can be handled,

720
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
gradually it works.

721
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
In my reality,

722
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it is not some basis,

723
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
there is a clear border,

724
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I have gradually realized it.

725
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Really,

726
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
timeliness in privacy

727
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
is another aspect

728
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that has developed in me,

729
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so really,

730
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
to realize what I publicize,

731
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the Internet is a public space

732
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
where we are not 100% sure

733
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
that our information

734
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
was not accessed by someone who did not have it,

735
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and easy migration,

736
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I am not dependent

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
simply

738
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
on one giga provider,

739
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I have services

740
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
divided

741
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
among various.

742
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Was it worth it?

743
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I counted it like that,

744
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
20 minutes a day,

745
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
in the last two years

746
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I have been running a diary,

747
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and I take it as a great success,

748
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
at least from my point of view,

749
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
it was very beneficial,

750
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because I really said

751
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
yes to myself,

752
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
self-awareness,

753
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
then

754
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I found out that apps

755
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
are an extension of life

756
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and not some basis,

757
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and technological independence

758
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is some kind of control

759
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
over your digital status,

760
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so I realize

761
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
what the providers and services

762
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
have about me,

763
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I never realize everything,

764
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but yes,

765
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I take the Internet

766
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
as a public space

767
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and I am sensitive

768
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to my privacy

769
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and to data.

770
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Here is another video

771
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
for the end,

772
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the transformation

773
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
of a man who is

774
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
entangled by threats

775
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and the digital space

776
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
devours him,

777
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
until he goes

778
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to the right place,

779
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
but I need him

780
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to the right limits,

781
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and if we don't see them,

782
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the realities seem to dominate

783
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
even the digital reality,

784
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and I just don't see

785
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the waste bin

786
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
that is full in the kitchen

787
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and I need to take it away.

788
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I decided to share

789
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
this story publicly,

790
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
so I write blogs on Substack,

791
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I also create YouTube videos

792
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and I want to communicate

793
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
to the world

794
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that there are people

795
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
like me here

796
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and I would be glad

797
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
if only one person

798
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
is inspired,

799
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
it will mean a lot to me

800
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
because I have gone

801
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
through the whole transformation

802
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and it really causes

803
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
a great damage

804
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
in a person's life

805
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
when he spends so much

806
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
on the computer,

807
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
a great concentration

808
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
in work,

809
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and this was my story

810
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and this is how I grew up

811
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
in the digital freedom

812
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and here are some links

813
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
at the end.

814
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you for your attention

815
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and I will be glad

816
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to talk about this topic.

817
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Is the microphone working?

818
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes, good.

819
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Thank you very much

820
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
for such an honest

821
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
introduction to your way.

822
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We will ask questions

823
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
in the classroom,

824
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
so I will give you the microphone

825
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to be recorded,

826
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
because the questions

827
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
that are in the audience

828
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
are not heard on the video recording.

829
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Who wants to start?

830
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because I have a lot of questions

831
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and we also have questions

832
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
on the slide.

833
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So, what do you want to start with?

834
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The application,

835
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but we need it here

836
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
because this is a tool.

837
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Let's start from the beginning.

838
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Have you ever tried going out

839
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
without a phone

840
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or having a phone

841
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that can only call

842
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
via SOS?

843
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think from the point of view

844
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
of concentration

845
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
on the real world.

846
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Ondrej signed.

847
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Without a phone,

848
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have a phone,

849
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but I have it so limited

850
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that I am there at that moment.

851
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I am where I am

852
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and when I need it,

853
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I pull it out of the pocket,

854
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but it is minimal.

855
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I think about whether there are such moments.

856
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Maybe you can also tell the audience

857
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
if you go somewhere like this.

858
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But I even have hours

859
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and those hours do not have a SIM card,

860
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
so I can really disconnect

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and I can record things

862
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
even if I don't have a phone with me.

863
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But you can imagine it, right?

864
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I know, I know.

865
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You got nervous.

866
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I can imagine it, of course.

867
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I am glad

868
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
when I have such a detox

869
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
from time to time.

870
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What does a phone look like to me?

871
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But we live in a digital age,

872
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
there are a lot of things on the Internet

873
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and there are very few

874
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
moments like that, really.

875
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I have to admit that

876
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
the phone is very often.

877
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
OK, I have a phone with me

878
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and I have to ask you

879
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
a related question.

880
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
When you disconnected completely,

881
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
when you turned off everything,

882
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
what signs did you feel?

883
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I mean, when a person

884
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
is abstinent,

885
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
exactly like that.

886
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Have any experts talked about it?

887
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Well,

888
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
there was a lot of writing

889
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
at that time.

890
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The time was really big

891
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and all the attention was mine

892
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and no one stole it from me,

893
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
no digital device.

894
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And hey,

895
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that was probably the sign of abstinence.

896
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I just needed to filter it

897
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
on the paper

898
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and really reflect on the situation in life.

899
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The habit of reflecting

900
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
allowed me

901
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to realize how much

902
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
technology has affected my life

903
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and to improve it.

904
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So I understand it that

905
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
your counter-step

906
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
was to compensate it with writing.

907
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes.

908
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When you wanted to use your phone,

909
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you used your diary

910
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and wrote something.

911
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We are all here

912
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in the technological world.

913
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Sometimes I go out

914
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
without a phone,

915
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but not far, like 2 km.

916
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So that's why I use my phone

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
as a safety device.

918
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I go running, cycling,

919
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
because I have it.

920
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I was still

921
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
2 km without a phone.

922
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's all I can say.

923
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And that's why

924
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm interested in

925
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
how you solved it,

926
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
because you can't get rid of it

927
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
every day,

928
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
like when there are other dependencies.

929
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That's probably my answer.

930
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's my extreme decision.

931
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I went through detox

932
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and deactivated my social networks

933
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and so on.

934
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I tried these approaches

935
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
in my life.

936
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But then it was such an extreme point

937
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that I realized

938
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that the digital space

939
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
doesn't work for me

940
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and I needed to cut with it.

941
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Maybe it's a bit

942
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
a unique case, I don't know.

943
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So your motivation was much stronger

944
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
than the signs.

945
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yes.

946
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Any other questions?

947
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We can go to the next one.

948
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The magician is asking about learning.

949
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Hmm.

950
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No, no,

951
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
only the magician is learning.

952
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Anyone? I'm reading.

953
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Aren't you starting to be paranoid?

954
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You solve alias and personal data on the Internet.

955
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
How does it relate to dependence

956
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
on technologies and digital freedom?

957
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay, good question.

958
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Good question, very good.

959
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Hey, that's...

960
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Maybe I mentioned it wrong

961
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
on my way, I don't know.

962
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I've given it a name so far,

963
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
technological independence.

964
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It made sense to me,

965
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
because after the time

966
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
when I had technologies again

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
in my life,

968
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I started to think

969
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
about my

970
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
digital feet

971
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and simply about some control

972
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
of who has my data.

973
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So...

974
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It can sound like that, yes.

975
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That I'm paranoid

976
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and that I solve problems.

977
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Really, when we publish something on the Internet,

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it's really public.

979
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And why would I ever solve some alias,

980
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
if I can really identify myself

981
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
with some other strategies

982
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
for fingerprinting.

983
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But there are some regulations

984
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that we know

985
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
as consumers,

986
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
as users,

987
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and we know how to do it.

988
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I think these are steps to privacy

989
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and to something that people

990
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
really want to grow.

991
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We are not really there,

992
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
companies collect various information about us

993
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and we are mostly okay with it.

994
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So these strategies like alias

995
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and data logging

996
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
really help us to realize

997
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
what is the digital feet

998
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and maybe make other decisions

999
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
than we would do under normal circumstances.

1000
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So it's just

1001
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
a new stage of development

1002
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
on my way

1003
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and that's how I identified it

1004
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and presented it.

1005
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So we can talk about it further.

1006
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know if this is enough.

1007
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The one who asked

1008
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the question was

1009
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
a very important question.

1010
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Let's put it simply.

1011
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What games did you like?

1012
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't you miss any?

1013
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What is your view

1014
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
on social games and quizzes?

1015
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And so on.

1016
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Great question.

1017
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Social games,

1018
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
yes, not so much.

1019
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What I really envy

1020
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
people who

1021
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
when they grew up

1022
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
lived more socially

1023
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
social games were

1024
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
their games

1025
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and not computer games.

1026
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I had computer games

1027
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
rather than social games

1028
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and it was signed to me.

1029
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Maybe you can see it

1030
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
through these

1031
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
now.

1032
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I played a lot of CS.

1033
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I grew up on Counter-Strike.

1034
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I had a dream to be a professional player.

1035
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We fought at home with my parents

1036
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
why do I spend 10 hours a day

1037
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
playing Counter-Strike and I went to tournaments in Slovakia.

1038
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That was my goal.

1039
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That is part of my journey.

1040
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That is why I am here today.

1041
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I grew up like this

1042
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and I had to face these problems

1043
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because

1044
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
it was signed.

1045
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So,

1046
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it was a easier question.

1047
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I play Counter-Strike.

1048
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Do you still play it?

1049
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I want to, but

1050
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the limits are clear.

1051
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It is there 2 hours a month.

1052
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay.

1053
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you know the book

1054
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Digital Minimalism by Kala Newporta?

1055
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Have you read the book?

1056
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I know Kala Newporta very well

1057
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and I haven't read this book.

1058
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I have read Deep Work.

1059
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It was the first book

1060
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that I got from this author

1061
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and then it was Slow Productivity.

1062
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That was a very good topic

1063
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
that he wrote.

1064
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But Digital Minimalism, no.

1065
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I haven't read any book

1066
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
about this principle

1067
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
in my presentation.

1068
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But maybe

1069
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
there are some types

1070
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
that I don't know.

1071
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So feel free to ask.

1072
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Are you going to read them?

1073
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It would be fine

1074
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
if I mentioned it like this.

1075
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Digital Minimalism

1076
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
is such an authority

1077
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
in this sphere

1078
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and it would certainly not be a shame

1079
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
to read it.

1080
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So you have more time

1081
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to read it.

1082
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That's true.

1083
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay.

1084
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I want something easier again.

1085
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But these are easy questions.

1086
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How long have you been

1087
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
on this path?

1088
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
On this path?

1089
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
As I mentioned at the beginning,

1090
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
during the year 2022

1091
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I took the radical step

1092
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that I wrote.

1093
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I cut off digital tools

1094
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and went to paper.

1095
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So the third year.

1096
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And you decided

1097
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that first of all

1098
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
you go to paper completely.

1099
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Fine. You needed a reset.

1100
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I understand.

1101
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then you came to

1102
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
where you could improve,

1103
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
optimize and speed up.

1104
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You got where you are.

1105
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Are you in the goal?

1106
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm definitely not in the goal.

1107
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And that's what I like the most

1108
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
about Digital Minimalism.

1109
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This story doesn't end.

1110
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This story continues.

1111
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There will always be

1112
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the same questions.

1113
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Where are my data?

1114
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Do I need this app?

1115
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What does this app do in my life?

1116
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Does it make my life easier?

1117
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Does it help me grow in a certain sphere?

1118
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Or not?

1119
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So it's a path

1120
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and that's how I present it.

1121
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Okay.

1122
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And what about you and Minimalism

1123
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
outside of digital space?

1124
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Are you trying to minimize

1125
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
anonymity?

1126
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes.

1127
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I have a very minimalistic

1128
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
room equipment.

1129
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And that's probably

1130
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
the only thing

1131
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
where it shows up.

1132
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I like Scandinavian

1133
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
equipment methods.

1134
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I imagined it a little differently.

1135
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Some famous CEOs

1136
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
to reduce

1137
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the burden of decisions

1138
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
only wear black t-shirts

1139
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
or blue t-shirts.

1140
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Are you aiming there?

1141
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm aiming there.

1142
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I think so.

1143
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I see in the audience

1144
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that the decision-making force

1145
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
is just falling down

1146
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
when I have to fix the color of the t-shirt.

1147
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's on the way, I think.

1148
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You think this will be the way.

1149
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But I agree.

1150
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't know.

1151
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Just ask your questions.

1152
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The one who asked the question

1153
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and is not satisfied with the answer,

1154
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
just ask.

1155
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Okay?

1156
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If my friend had a smaller t-shirt,

1157
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I wouldn't have to

1158
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
advise her and praise

1159
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
what she wants to wear.

1160
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That would save me time.

1161
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
She's not here at all.

1162
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So it's okay.

1163
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But you can hear it.

1164
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You know we're recording.

1165
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay.

1166
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So you're trying to

1167
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
minimize the decision-making.

1168
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Regarding the burden of decision-making

1169
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
or the demands of decision-making,

1170
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Getting Things Done.

1171
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes, definitely.

1172
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It's closely related to that.

1173
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Have you tried it?

1174
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Do you plan it?

1175
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Don't you want it?

1176
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Is it complicated?

1177
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I have a personal hybrid approach to it.

1178
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I have Bullet Journal Method

1179
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and GTD.

1180
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Rather,

1181
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the phase when I get information,

1182
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Capture,

1183
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
there is definitely

1184
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
a realization of the importance

1185
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
of the thing.

1186
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I use it often,

1187
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
but not specifically.

1188
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I don't have it implemented specifically

1189
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
in my life,

1190
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
but I see the value

1191
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and I want to reveal it in the future.

1192
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay.

1193
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The concepts are often similar.

1194
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
For those who don't know what GTD is,

1195
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Getting Things Done,

1196
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
it's all done in Czech and Slovak.

1197
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't know what the translation is.

1198
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
From my point of view,

1199
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
it's an unfortunate name,

1200
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
but that's just my opinion.

1201
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Who would like to learn more?

1202
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We have two meet-ups on this topic

1203
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
in the archive on YouTube.

1204
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Getting Things Done.

1205
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You can watch it too.

1206
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Thank you.

1207
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
How do you work on creating

1208
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the right habits

1209
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and how do you distinguish

1210
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
good and bad habits?

1211
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'll put it this way.

1212
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I have a very simple approach

1213
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
to habits at the moment.

1214
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's the minimalistic approach

1215
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in my life too.

1216
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I measure only six things

1217
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
every day.

1218
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I don't know if I should present it like this.

1219
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm thinking if it's useful for you.

1220
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Of course.

1221
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because we want to know

1222
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
how you decide.

1223
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It doesn't have to mean

1224
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that I'm going to have the same process,

1225
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
but maybe I don't have any.

1226
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
As I mentioned,

1227
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
my work is very flexible.

1228
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The most important thing for me

1229
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is to realize every day

1230
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
what is needed,

1231
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
what I need to focus on.

1232
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because if there is unlimited flexibility,

1233
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
that day probably won't turn out well

1234
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
if I don't catch it.

1235
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
My every day consists of

1236
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
standing in the right time.

1237
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's a great luxury

1238
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
to be able to stand when I want.

1239
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But I want to achieve for myself

1240
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
to stand in front of a certain time.

1241
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That's the first step in a given day.

1242
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Then I really want to do

1243
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the hardest task in a given day

1244
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
that awaits me.

1245
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Here I need to define the day before.

1246
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So that's another habit.

1247
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Then I have to focus

1248
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
on each of the important areas in life.

1249
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So work, relationships

1250
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and health.

1251
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Let's say running,

1252
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
or going to the store,

1253
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
or anything else related to movement.

1254
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I need to build personal relationships,

1255
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
meeting with family, friends,

1256
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
colleagues.

1257
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I also need to work on

1258
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
projects I don't care about.

1259
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So I really

1260
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
focused on

1261
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
these five habits.

1262
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And the sixth is

1263
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
preparing for the next day.

1264
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Of course, it's a day of reflection.

1265
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's about realizing

1266
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
what awaits me the next day

1267
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and what is the biggest,

1268
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the hardest task for the next day.

1269
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's very simple.

1270
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I use this framework,

1271
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
if I can call it that.

1272
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Maybe it will expand into the future.

1273
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But I think these are all

1274
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
some good habits.

1275
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The magician is an action.

1276
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Is the answer enough?

1277
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because I don't know how to react.

1278
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes?

1279
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Good.

1280
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I wanted to ask

1281
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
an easy question.

1282
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
How did you

1283
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
make up for the time you spent

1284
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
in the digital hell?

1285
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Are you learning something new?

1286
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Are you making wreaths?

1287
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
At the moment,

1288
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
as I mentioned,

1289
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
you can see the link there,

1290
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I spend a lot of time on that.

1291
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I learn to make videos

1292
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and share my story.

1293
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's a storytelling skill,

1294
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I would say.

1295
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And reading books

1296
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
is definitely part of my life.

1297
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The latest autobiography

1298
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
by Bill Gates,

1299
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Source Code,

1300
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I read it.

1301
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So books are definitely

1302
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
a place for me.

1303
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And some personal projects

1304
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
that reflect my values.

1305
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I would add to that,

1306
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
when you mentioned

1307
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
that your robot

1308
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
is your web development.

1309
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
When you are more

1310
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
detached from things,

1311
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
don't you think that you are a bit behind

1312
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
when it comes to

1313
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
all these technologies

1314
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
moving quite fast?

1315
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
When it comes to online intelligence,

1316
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
when it comes to all the things

1317
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
regarding the digital age

1318
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that you need for your robot?

1319
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So,

1320
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
don't you think

1321
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
that you are behind

1322
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
in these topics?

1323
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Thank you for your question.

1324
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I am still choosing newsletters,

1325
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I am still following on social networks

1326
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that serve me,

1327
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I am still following people

1328
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
who are in the space,

1329
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
authorities and technologies

1330
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
are developing very fast.

1331
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And I need to stay in touch

1332
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and therefore I have a certain space

1333
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
when I devote my time to it.

1334
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But it is a very closed space

1335
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and I need

1336
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
to develop

1337
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
a large activity.

1338
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It is not so easy for me

1339
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
to simply click on a web address.

1340
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I need to realize

1341
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that now is the time.

1342
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It is not automatic

1343
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and there is really a border

1344
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
between technology and my time.

1345
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I know when this time is

1346
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and I am still in touch

1347
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
but I don't get the warnings

1348
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that they will stop me at a given moment.

1349
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The fact that the React 19 version came out

1350
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
on Monday morning.

1351
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So basically you have it

1352
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
incorporated into your habits

1353
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
that you deal with.

1354
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yes.

1355
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Any questions

1356
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
directly from the audience?

1357
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Because there are questions

1358
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
in the chat.

1359
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Maybe we have some active viewers

1360
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
on YouTube, but I don't think so.

1361
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Or?

1362
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
In the back, admit it.

1363
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So you are sitting here.

1364
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What do you miss

1365
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
from the digital world

1366
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
when you are talking about

1367
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
some of the digital tools?

1368
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What do I miss?

1369
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yes.

1370
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I read it like this.

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What do you miss

1372
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
from the digital world

1373
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
when you are talking about

1374
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
some of the tools?

1375
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Or more precisely?

1376
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think I try to use

1377
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
everything good.

1378
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Good for me is

1379
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
something bad for others.

1380
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That's it.

1381
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I don't know

1382
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
if it answers the question.

1383
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I understood it like this.

1384
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
At the beginning

1385
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
you gave up everything.

1386
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
But then you wanted

1387
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
all the good things

1388
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that should serve you

1389
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
as a tool,

1390
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that should help you

1391
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
survive in the digital world.

1392
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Unfortunately,

1393
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
it's true.

1394
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But the navigation in this world,

1395
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
you choose the tools

1396
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that are good

1397
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and that served you before.

1398
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Except Counter-Strike.

1399
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Do you miss games?

1400
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I don't miss games

1401
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
because I replaced this time

1402
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
with some time

1403
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that is more profitable for me.

1404
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It was a stage in my life

1405
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
when games were in first place.

1406
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But the good things,

1407
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I find them all the time.

1408
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I can't answer

1409
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
this question.

1410
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Sorry.

1411
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Ask it differently.

1412
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I have the microphone here.

1413
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I think

1414
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
this question

1415
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
because it sounded like

1416
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
you just got rid of

1417
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
all the bad things

1418
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and all the good things

1419
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
stayed with you.

1420
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But it also had

1421
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
some advantages.

1422
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
There was no black and white,

1423
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
that I threw away

1424
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
all the bad things

1425
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and all the good things stayed with me.

1426
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Maybe you had to

1427
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
choose something good

1428
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
to get some time

1429
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
or something like that.

1430
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Isn't it something

1431
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
that was good for you

1432
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
but you had to give up

1433
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
because you miss it now?

1434
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Thank you for the question.

1435
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I think I don't have

1436
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
anything to say about Facebook.

1437
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It was a radical step.

1438
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I removed it.

1439
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It wasn't deactivation.

1440
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
My profile doesn't exist.

1441
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
There are only close people there.

1442
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I like to learn

1443
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
some things from them.

1444
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
When I said extreme step,

1445
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I said no to all these people.

1446
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Maybe Facebook is really good.

1447
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But at that point

1448
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
in my life

1449
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
it wasn't good

1450
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to have something

1451
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that is not good for me.

1452
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm thinking

1453
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
of guilty pleasures.

1454
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Somebody can help me

1455
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
with Slovak?

1456
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
How to translate it?

1457
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What are your

1458
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
sinful uses?

1459
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The newest

1460
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
when I open sora.ch

1461
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I see those generated videos

1462
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
from artificial intelligence

1463
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and it is a joy

1464
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's not artificially created, but it's so perfect, almost perfect, that I finally caught myself, I spent maybe 20 minutes there and I felt very bad about it.

1465
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Inspiration as well, but also very bad.

1466
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I got goosebumps.

1467
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I started to get nervous.

1468
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But it's great.

1469
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Sorry, it's a tool for generating videos using artificial intelligence.

1470
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The modern tool that was created two years ago with the boom of artificial intelligence.

1471
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
There were also tools that generate pictures, videos, texts and so on.

1472
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Everything is related to it.

1473
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And unfortunately, those videos are starting to be very, very convincing.

1474
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Unfortunately, fortunately, that's the point of view.

1475
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And that's the point of view.

1476
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's either a tool or some other tool that controls me.

1477
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Or it controls the reality that we encounter around us.

1478
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Recently, they started to generate real text for those videos.

1479
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Until now, artificial intelligence didn't do it.

1480
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The text was so messed up and now it's really possible to read it.

1481
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So you can spend more time there.

1482
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That's the problem.

1483
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What are the disadvantages of digital minimalism in your opinion?

1484
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Hey, there can be the risk of scrupulence.

1485
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I think that solving the puzzle, whether I'm paranoid or not.

1486
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And whether I'm not solving these aspects in life in too much detail.

1487
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I think that's such a danger, I would say.

1488
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Not that it's a disadvantage.

1489
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And that's everywhere.

1490
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
In fact, the danger of those extreme sides.

1491
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
To be in the most extreme, perhaps.

1492
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Find the middle.

1493
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Disadvantages.

1494
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I really see it that way.

1495
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I come out of my system on paper.

1496
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And through that paper I solve my digital space and life.

1497
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Therefore, digital minimalism is something I don't think about.

1498
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And it's natural.

1499
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I simply know, I realize which digital tools have what role in my life.

1500
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And I evaluate it from the real world.

1501
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Not within the digital realm.

1502
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So it makes sense what I said.

1503
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I just read the question.

1504
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I should have the question, but I'd rather ask if it fits.

1505
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
We can have one more question.

1506
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm also writing a diary.

1507
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And sometimes I think that it would be more effective

1508
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
for a person to be able to find something.

1509
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
To have it at least in some word.

1510
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But for some reason, it's a habit.

1511
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And maybe it's more pleasant.

1512
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm still doing it by hand.

1513
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And now I see that maybe there's some...

1514
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So this aspect, that it can be used better.

1515
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
If you're looking for something, it's definitely much harder on paper.

1516
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So would you say anything to that?

1517
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you very much for the question.

1518
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I definitely solved it in my life.

1519
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I think it's the same.

1520
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's definitely in some points.

1521
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That paper.

1522
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And really in that method,

1523
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Bullet Journal specifically,

1524
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
which helped me make this important step in my life.

1525
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So there's an index or content, as we have in books.

1526
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We simply know the index pages.

1527
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's probably some kind of basic orientation within a book.

1528
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And the viewing can sometimes be wrong there.

1529
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So far, I personally haven't had such a need.

1530
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But I can imagine that in the future,

1531
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
we'll want to get some ideas.

1532
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I won't know where the idea is.

1533
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
The idea is in what year, in what month, in what day.

1534
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I think that in my life,

1535
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
viewing means that I have to digitize my information.

1536
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And at the moment, I don't see a method that would allow me

1537
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
to take my information from paper

1538
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and make it, let's say, locally on a machine.

1539
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It wouldn't go anywhere to the Internet.

1540
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Because I don't want it to be on the Internet.

1541
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's the problem.

1542
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So really, the index has a great importance

1543
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
when it comes to privacy and control.

1544
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And I never want to give up on it.

1545
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I don't see...

1546
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Maybe there's potential for innovation here.

1547
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
There are also, I think,

1548
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Remarkable and various companies

1549
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
that develop tablets

1550
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
where we can digitize writing.

1551
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
But again, there's privacy there

1552
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and the fact that it goes into the cloud.

1553
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So no, at the moment,

1554
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I say no to viewing.

1555
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't need this function.

1556
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And I'd rather save an hour or two

1557
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
by listing pages,

1558
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
when it's really that important

1559
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
and I'll have to find it somewhere.

1560
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
When you write it,

1561
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
do you feel like you can remember it more,

1562
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
feel it,

1563
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and then you know that you've written it?

1564
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't know,

1565
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
like your brain works that way,

1566
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
that it's maybe natural,

1567
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
or that you create some kind of connection

1568
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
between your hands

1569
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and maybe some kind of awareness

1570
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
that you wrote it and so on,

1571
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and then you know that it's written there?

1572
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Does it work that way somehow?

1573
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yes, the memory is much more

1574
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
forced by the habit of writing things.

1575
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And that's why I think

1576
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
that writing never disappears,

1577
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
because yes, we try to digitize,

1578
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
to make it more effective,

1579
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but in the process of making it more effective,

1580
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
we come to some kind of life function

1581
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and we don't even realize it.

1582
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Simply put,

1583
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the memory is definitely more stretched

1584
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and I have a feeling

1585
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that there's a bigger order in my life

1586
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
when I know that.

1587
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
When I can write it.

1588
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yes, therefore,

1589
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
you need to be more aware of it.

1590
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And really,

1591
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
when a person needs to write something,

1592
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
four or two times,

1593
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you ask yourself

1594
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
if it's worth it,

1595
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
the performance of writing,

1596
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
because when I click on it,

1597
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
really,

1598
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
the connection in the head

1599
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
is not that strong

1600
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and I think it flows faster,

1601
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
so I definitely don't know

1602
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
how to write today, I think.

1603
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Okay, can you imagine

1604
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the evolution of Star Trek,

1605
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
the ship diary,

1606
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and that you dictate it

1607
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
and then you can easily look it up,

1608
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
because there are technologies for it today.

1609
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
For what?

1610
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Instead of writing in a journal,

1611
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
you can dictate things,

1612
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
as if you know a diary

1613
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
that is actually spoken,

1614
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
instead of being written,

1615
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and today there are technologies

1616
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
that can actually do this.

1617
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Can you imagine

1618
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
this kind of development

1619
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
in the future?

1620
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Actually,

1621
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm still talking to ChatGPT

1622
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and,

1623
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
it will help me a lot

1624
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
when, really,

1625
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a person wants to speed up

1626
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
the activity of

1627
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
marking thoughts

1628
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and, simply,

1629
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
there is the answer on the other side.

1630
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I don't know

1631
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
how it affects the memory,

1632
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
how it works,

1633
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
when a person

1634
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
says something

1635
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and doesn't write it down anymore.

1636
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I would like to try

1637
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
to do such an experiment,

1638
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
what it would actually mean

1639
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
for my routine.

1640
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Would you take it

1641
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
in a positive direction?

1642
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I would maybe add

1643
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
to the digitalization

1644
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
of the written diary,

1645
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
so,

1646
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
if you are mainly

1647
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
talking about safety

1648
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and the fact that

1649
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
it wouldn't reach anywhere,

1650
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I think that now

1651
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
there are some local

1652
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
LLM models,

1653
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
which you can install

1654
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
directly into your computer

1655
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and which will lead you

1656
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
to extract the text

1657
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
from the picture

1658
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and then you can put it

1659
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
into a local document

1660
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
or something like that.

1661
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So, I think

1662
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
that we are not so far

1663
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
from the fact

1664
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
that it will be possible

1665
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
to digitize it

1666
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
quite simply

1667
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and if you have it,

1668
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
basically,

1669
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
it is always available

1670
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and you can scan it

1671
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
or scan it

1672
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
at any time

1673
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
so, I think

1674
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
that we are not so far

1675
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
from the fact

1676
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
that it will be possible

1677
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
to digitize it

1678
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
quite simply

1679
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and to have it

1680
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
only locally

1681
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
on hard disk

1682
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
or not to send it anywhere.

1683
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
For example,

1684
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I personally

1685
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
use writing

1686
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
on a diary

1687
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
which is called

1688
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Obsidian

1689
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
which generates

1690
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Markdown files

1691
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
which,

1692
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
if I don't want to,

1693
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't have to send them

1694
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
to the cloud.

1695
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So, I sort of

1696
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
deal with it

1697
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
in this way

1698
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
but,

1699
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
as you have already

1700
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
mentioned,

1701
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
even when

1702
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
something is being said

1703
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
or when

1704
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the diary is being made

1705
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
with the spoken word,

1706
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
that is another thing,

1707
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that even

1708
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
when

1709
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
there are

1710
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
LLM models

1711
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
which know

1712
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
the speech

1713
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
you can put it

1714
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
into

1715
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
some

1716
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
kind of

1717
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
digital form

1718
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
which can be

1719
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
searched for.

1720
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So, I think

1721
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
there are

1722
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
some possibilities

1723
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
which will not be

1724
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
such a problem

1725
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
in the future

1726
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and it is

1727
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
one thing

1728
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
with the other

1729
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
that it can be

1730
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
combined like this.

1731
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Thank you

1732
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
for the interview.

1733
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It sounded

1734
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
very nice.

1735
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Maybe

1736
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
my paranoia

1737
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
is that

1738
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I would probably

1739
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
need some

1740
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
personal hardware

1741
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
which is never

1742
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
on the Internet.

1743
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I would probably

1744
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
solve it like this

1745
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
with a health code.

1746
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
We don't see

1747
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
what happens

1748
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
with the information

1749
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
in real life.

1750
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I don't want

1751
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
to digitize it.

1752
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It is simply

1753
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
my personal space

1754
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and that is where

1755
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the border

1756
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
between me

1757
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and technology

1758
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
is created

1759
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and I think

1760
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it will remain

1761
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
like this.

1762
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
There is

1763
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
no such

1764
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
device

1765
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
which would

1766
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
allow

1767
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
me to

1768
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
separate

1769
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the diary

1770
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
and the speech

1771
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I don't know.

1772
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
A hole in the market.

1773
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A hole in the market.

1774
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I don't know

1775
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
how to

1776
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
put it

1777
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
in words.

1778
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
But I think

1779
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
we should

1780
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
ask the audience

1781
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
a question.

1782
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Apart

1783
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
from the people

1784
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
in the audience

1785
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
have you met

1786
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
people with

1787
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
a negative reaction

1788
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
to the way

1789
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you have

1790
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
been

1791
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
going?

1792
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yes.

1793
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yes,

1794
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
many times.

1795
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It is very

1796
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
polarizing.

1797
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Some people

1798
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
really don't

1799
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
understand

1800
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
how I

1801
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
grew up

1802
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
in my life.

1803
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I think

1804
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the starting point

1805
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
in life

1806
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
influences

1807
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
the way

1808
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
of the individual.

1809
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And I have a feeling

1810
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
that there are

1811
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
many young people

1812
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
who go

1813
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the same way

1814
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
as me

1815
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and the more

1816
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
sophisticated

1817
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
algorithms

1818
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
we see

1819
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
which

1820
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
always

1821
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
know

1822
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
to get

1823
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
more attention

1824
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
from us.

1825
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And really

1826
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
when a person

1827
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
grows up

1828
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
today

1829
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
he can grow

1830
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
to a similar

1831
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
level.

1832
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And that is

1833
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
what I would

1834
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
like to say.

1835
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Maybe.

1836
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Hello,

1837
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I am Tomáš.

1838
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I would like

1839
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
to ask

1840
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
if you

1841
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
could

1842
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
come back

1843
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
to your

1844
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
childhood,

1845
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
would you

1846
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
need

1847
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
something

1848
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
different

1849
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
from your

1850
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
parents?

1851
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And then

1852
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
the question

1853
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
is what

1854
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
would you

1855
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
advise

1856
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
parents

1857
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
towards

1858
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
children

1859
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
in digital

1860
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
freedom?

1861
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Or other

1862
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
members

1863
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
of your

1864
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
close

1865
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
circle?

1866
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Thank you

1867
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
for the

1868
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
question.

1869
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Hey,

1870
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
certainly

1871
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
not.

1872
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
My parents

1873
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
did everything

1874
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
they could.

1875
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I can

1876
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
say that

1877
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
one hundred percent.

1878
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
My hard

1879
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
head was

1880
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
very there.

1881
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I was

1882
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
strict

1883
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and I

1884
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
told myself

1885
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
what I would

1886
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
do.

1887
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And so

1888
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it is

1889
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
how I

1890
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
spend

1891
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
my time.

1892
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And today

1893
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
they are

1894
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
satisfied

1895
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
because they see

1896
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
that I have

1897
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
chosen,

1898
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
thank God,

1899
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
the other

1900
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
way.

1901
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I try to

1902
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
bring

1903
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
society

1904
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
not

1905
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
fun

1906
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
by playing

1907
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
games and

1908
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
looking

1909
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
at me

1910
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and paying

1911
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
sponsors,

1912
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
but I

1913
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
try to

1914
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
solve

1915
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
some

1916
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
logical

1917
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
problems.

1918
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I am not a

1919
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
psychologist

1920
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and I am

1921
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
afraid to

1922
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
talk a

1923
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
little

1924
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
about this

1925
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
because

1926
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
really

1927
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
every

1928
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
person is

1929
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
different and

1930
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
something

1931
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
that is

1932
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
different

1933
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
from

1934
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
another

1935
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
person

1936
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
works

1937
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
on me

1938
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and it

1939
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
is

1940
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
hard

1941
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
because

1942
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I have

1943
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
personally

1944
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
seen

1945
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
other

1946
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
people around

1947
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
me who

1948
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
can solve

1949
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
these things

1950
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
at this

1951
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
low level

1952
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and it

1953
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
was hard

1954
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
to solve

1955
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
it

1956
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
by my

1957
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
parents,

1958
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I really

1959
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
realize that

1960
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and

1961
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I think

1962
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
it is

1963
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
a topic

1964
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
rather for

1965
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
a psychologist

1966
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I would say

1967
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and maybe

1968
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
the cooperation

1969
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
of psychology

1970
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
with some

1971
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
person who

1972
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
went through

1973
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
such a

1974
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
story

1975
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
like

1976
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
it worked

1977
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
that it

1978
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
would take it

1979
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
or rather not

1980
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
because

1981
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
they haven't

1982
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
seen it yet

1983
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and haven't

1984
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
experienced it

1985
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and you think

1986
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that 10 years

1987
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
when it

1988
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
would be

1989
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
a common thing

1990
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
when a parent

1991
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
would be

1992
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
an example

1993
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
to his child

1994
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
that it

1995
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
could help him

1996
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
pure speculation

1997
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
very complex

1998
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
question on

1999
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
me at

2000
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
this hour

2001
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
and days

2002
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
please

2003
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
please simplify

2004
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Rado if

2005
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
you know

2006
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
more about

2007
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
education

2008
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
whether at school

2009
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
or parents

2010
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
or parents

2011
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
children

2012
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but not

2013
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
certainly

2014
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
only from

2015
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
one direction

2016
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I mean

2017
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
more general

2018
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
education

2019
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
from

2020
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
elementary school

2021
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
specifically

2022
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
this topic

2023
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
maybe

2024
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
they don't call it

2025
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
digital freedom

2026
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
but

2027
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
somehow

2028
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
otherwise

2029
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
but something

2030
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
similar

2031
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
what do you think

2032
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
about it

2033
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
question

2034
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
is that

2035
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
it is important

2036
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
to have

2037
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
some space

2038
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
where a person

2039
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
can come

2040
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
when he is at

2041
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
the point

2042
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
that he knows

2043
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that these technologies

2044
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
do not serve him

2045
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but rather he serves

2046
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
technology

2047
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
that there is

2048
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
some place

2049
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
where he can

2050
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
find these

2051
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
resources

2052
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
so education

2053
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
certainly

2054
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
whether it goes

2055
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
through some

2056
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
idols

2057
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
in society

2058
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
or it goes

2059
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
through school

2060
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and through

2061
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
school system

2062
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and state

2063
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or some other

2064
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
institutions

2065
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
in the way

2066
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it is

2067
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
something

2068
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that

2069
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
was created

2070
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
even

2071
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
when I

2072
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
prepared

2073
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
this meet up

2074
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
that

2075
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
digital freedom

2076
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
is a

2077
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
digital

2078
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
problem

2079
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
because

2080
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I started

2081
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to solve

2082
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
this topic

2083
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
in English

2084
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and I try

2085
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
to have

2086
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
as much

2087
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
as possible

2088
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
to have

2089
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
it

2090
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
that's

2091
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and that's the place I want to exist on the Internet, not on the Internet, but between people.

2092
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It's my story and I want as few people as possible to follow this path.

2093
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:40,000
OK. Tomáš, would you like to rephrase the question? Because there was no answer.

2094
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I think it's more about the opportunities.

2095
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
For example, I deleted my history on YouTube and there's nothing there.

2096
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So we can't look at anything that might bother you.

2097
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
If the child doesn't have a tablet, he won't look at the tablet.

2098
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Or if there's no picture in the close-up.

2099
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I think it's more about the opportunities that we can adjust.

2100
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm not a parent, so I don't know.

2101
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's more about the influence of the environment and the school.

2102
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Exclusion within the group is a bigger problem than not having a mobile or tablet.

2103
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But I represent it, so it's a discussion.

2104
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't have children either, but I have a similar story with games.

2105
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I think we should ask the child why they like to play games

2106
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and why it's like that.

2107
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Because every child can have a different reason.

2108
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
For example, he wants to be the best he or she wants to be.

2109
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
The winner of a tournament in Slovakia.

2110
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The master.

2111
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Or the child is simply interested in games or mechanics that attract the child.

2112
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And various other things.

2113
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But today the games are a bit different than they used to be.

2114
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
When it was a single player.

2115
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
There's also the socialization.

2116
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I play with other people.

2117
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
We talk on the phone or with friends.

2118
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
With classmates from school.

2119
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And someone said in the past.

2120
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It was also a child from school.

2121
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
That we don't go out together.

2122
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Because everyone goes to play games.

2123
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
All friends.

2124
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So we meet at home at the computer and talk on the phone together.

2125
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And other friends don't go out very much.

2126
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There is a closed system.

2127
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Maybe parents can somehow break it.

2128
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
But if the children themselves don't want it.

2129
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I don't know what to do in that case.

2130
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Or whether it should be changed.

2131
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That's the problem with regulations.

2132
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I'm thinking.

2133
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
What can a single person do.

2134
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
When the group of people is simply four out of five.

2135
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
They are behind the computer.

2136
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
What can a single person do.

2137
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It would probably have to go up there.

2138
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
That's something that's probably not visible in today's society.

2139
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
There is Tik Tok.

2140
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And someone is trying to regulate it.

2141
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Because we see.

2142
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Those psychological consequences.

2143
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Maybe really hard rules.

2144
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
As far as using devices at school.

2145
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Or at home.

2146
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I can't imagine it personally.

2147
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And it's a fight.

2148
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yes.

2149
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I would go back completely to the beginning.

2150
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
That you said.

2151
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
When you went into that complete detox.

2152
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't know if I noticed.

2153
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
How long did it take.

2154
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That you came back in some way.

2155
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
To some social network.

2156
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Or to some application.

2157
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
How long was it?

2158
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Half a year?

2159
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Month?

2160
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Week?

2161
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Or how long?

2162
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Thank you.

2163
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And another question.

2164
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
How did the first days look like?

2165
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It must have been quite strange.

2166
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I imagine.

2167
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You sit.

2168
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You look.

2169
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
What now?

2170
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Thank you for the question.

2171
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It wasn't like.

2172
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I look at the ceiling.

2173
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I don't know what to do.

2174
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Rather.

2175
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
There is another part of the story.

2176
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It wasn't the only extreme decision.

2177
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That I made in that period of my life.

2178
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
There.

2179
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
There.

2180
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I went.

2181
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yes.

2182
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
All in.

2183
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
To some of my projects.

2184
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It didn't work.

2185
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And I wasn't productive.

2186
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And that was another reason.

2187
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Why?

2188
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Why did I decide to go this way?

2189
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Because.

2190
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I needed to know how to focus.

2191
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
On what I need to do.

2192
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The first application.

2193
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It was.

2194
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
As I mentioned.

2195
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
When I don't have a diary with me.

2196
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I need to remember.

2197
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Those thoughts.

2198
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And so on.

2199
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
During the run.

2200
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So.

2201
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I need it.

2202
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Some management.

2203
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And so on.

2204
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And so on.

2205
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And so on.

2206
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And so on.

2207
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Or.

2208
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I had.

2209
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Any hold.

2210
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Everything.

2211
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
In the letter.

2212
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And the memory.

2213
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Aand.

2214
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Of a day.

2215
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Healing days.

2216
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And it.

2217
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Was.

2218
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
The first application.

2219
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Which.

2220
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Holding.

2221
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Temporarily.

2222
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Holding.

2223
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
This was.

2224
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
A temporary estajun for.

2225
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
My puzzle.

2226
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And what I later.

2227
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Transfer to.

2228
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
The newspaper.

2229
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So it was.

2230
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The first application.

2231
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And it.

2232
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Danke 해요.

2233
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Muito rápido.

2234
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
действительно Thus.

2235
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I saw.

2236
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Maybe they like it, but it didn't work for me, so I decided to go digital.

2237
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So it was a short period, but as far as a social network is concerned,

2238
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,000
which is designed to attract people, when I decided to insert such an application into my life again,

2239
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:26,000
it was probably, hey, maybe so, I don't know, three or four months, plus or minus,

2240
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I realized that why not use food, because others motivate me to move, so I'm going to use food.

2241
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
That's how it can be.

2242
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I have a simple question, that if you, all of us here, or those who are watching this on YouTube,

2243
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
would recommend one thing,

2244
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
what would you have from what you implemented into your life,

2245
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
what do you think gave you the most positive effects,

2246
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
or what helped you the most in your digital transformation?

2247
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
If each of us had to pick one thing, whether it's a diary, a screen time limit,

2248
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
or what exactly would you recommend?

2249
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Thank you for the question.

2250
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
On my way, that's probably me,

2251
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
it's clear that it was to make radical decisions.

2252
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Simply, yes, one thing is to give up all digital tools,

2253
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
but then, for example, to shut down Facebook,

2254
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
not to think that the world will simply collapse when these connections stop working in the virtual sphere.

2255
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Really take the phone numbers of people I care about and contact them via the phone,

2256
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
eliminate these types that are useless,

2257
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
that don't serve people primarily.

2258
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So, to be radical is not just to deactivate for some time.

2259
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
To really make these cruel decisions, I would say,

2260
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,000
because, at least for me, it was not very easy to realize that Facebook is not worth living on,

2261
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
and I don't know how many friends I have there, or who.

2262
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I think that people solve this a lot.

2263
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And you have to do the short thing.

2264
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The energy that I simply have at the end of using the application,

2265
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
if it is not positive, why should it be in my life?

2266
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So, don't be afraid to step out and mention the problem that the energy is negative.

2267
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So, I really can't be present.

2268
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
That's the first step I recommend to everyone.

2269
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Realize if I really live this moment.

2270
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
For example, I'm here with you.

2271
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I can be here and my thoughts are present here.

2272
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Or rather, I'm drawn to some other world where there is isolation from me.

2273
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Radical decisions.

2274
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
The last two questions.

2275
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
How many hours of your day do you spend at the painting in a digital space?

2276
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Can you maybe distinguish that work is one thing,

2277
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
and somehow strictly distinguish it?

2278
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Maybe you think that I measure these things, but...

2279
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You don't measure?

2280
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I don't measure it.

2281
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And...

2282
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yes, I measure the time for projects at work.

2283
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And I have a very good view there,

2284
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that definitely at work eight hours a day.

2285
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
At the moment, this project is really demanding.

2286
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And it demands.

2287
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
But...

2288
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
As for some free time,

2289
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I can say a lot.

2290
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I think one series, one part is enough.

2291
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Simply, that time is definitely not...

2292
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Ten hours.

2293
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I think it's definitely not a day.

2294
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
If we count work as eight hours,

2295
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
it's not just eight hours,

2296
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
so six plus two hours of fun.

2297
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Good.

2298
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Eight hours of free time.

2299
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But take it like this,

2300
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
that I simply work on a computer,

2301
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and that's the activity I do every day in the working week.

2302
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So...

2303
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This is how it looks today in the digital world.

2304
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And a completely practical question at the end.

2305
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Do you consider that you would have finished programming

2306
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and go to work outside of digital?

2307
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Apart from digital?

2308
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
No, no, no.

2309
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I don't want to do such an extreme thing again.

2310
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Digital...

2311
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Digital definitely belongs to our lives.

2312
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
No, no.

2313
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like, yes, you have to make extreme decisions,

2314
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
but again, in the field of technology,

2315
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
you don't have to rely completely on technology.

2316
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I don't even want to say that this way of mine.

2317
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You really have to restart that relationship

2318
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
when a person needs it.

2319
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And I restarted it,

2320
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and I simply see that technology,

2321
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
has a great potential.

2322
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And I really want to show that you can get them under control.

2323
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And that's what I was trying to tell you today.

2324
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Thank you.

2325
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Thank you very much, Samo.

2326
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I have a feeling that your presentation

2327
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
was just to spread the discussion.

2328
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I'm glad it turned out that way.

2329
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That's how I imagined it.

2330
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It looks like it would be,

2331
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
that it would also be enjoyed in part two.

2332
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So sometime at the end of the year,

2333
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
we can agree and talk about some improvements,

2334
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
about optimization,

2335
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and maybe about how your project is going,

2336
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and whether you are already at the finish line.

2337
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So we're finishing the official part.

2338
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You can stay here, of course.

2339
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Of course, if you have any questions,

2340
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
please do.

2341
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I look forward to seeing you on the month of April 24.

2342
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
LinkedIn.

2343
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Don't forget to come.

2344
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
LinkedIn Guru is coming.

2345
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Thank you.

2346
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
We have Tatra's stickers too, right?

2347
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I forgot to mention that.

2348
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
As always.
